This is a discord bot script. It uses discord.js.

To make it function just change directory to the folder containing the bot and write new JSON file called "token.JSON" in this format:

{
    "token" : "your-token-goes-here"
}

To run, just change your current directory to be ~/discordBot-dad and type: "node bot.js" into terminal.
